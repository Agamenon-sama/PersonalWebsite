                <p>
                    Hello. My name is Chams Eddine Hachani, currently a student in the University of Pécs, Hungary, pursuing
                    a bachelor a degree in Computer Science Engineering. I decided to study computer science as my passion
                    for computers kept making me dig deeper and deeper into the inner functioning of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently looking for a role where I can learn more and grow as a programmer with the help of talented
                    team members who would share their experience with me.
                </p>

                            <p>Cataract is a port scanner for Linux</p>
                            <p>The project is compossed of a command line interface and a 
                                graphical user interface written with Qt as well as libCataract, 
                                a library that contains all the scanning capabilities of cataract 
                                intended to be embedded in other C++ applications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project started as an assignment in the computer network class but it was also 
                                an opportunity to brush up my Qt knowledge. The scanning capabilities of this software are 
                                still limited but I'm planning to add more advanced scanning like SYN scan and ping scan.

                            <p>Migraine is an attempt to create a full environment for Chip8</p>
                            <p>The project implements a chip8 emulator (interpreter) to execute chip8 programs
                                as well as an assembler to write those programs more easily. I also want to
                                implement a compiler but that will be for a later time. In order to help with
                                debugging, I am also implementing debugging tools like a real-time view of
                                the memory and registers as well as a disassembler to help reverse engineer
                                existing programs.

                                I started the project as an attempt to learn more about computer architecture.
                                Little by little, the project started getting in size as I started getting more ambitious.
                                I just hope I'll live to my own expectations.
